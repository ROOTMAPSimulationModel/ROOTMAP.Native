1. RMParentFrame seems to be handling all the generation of the basic RootMap window and bringing it up
	ready for use.
2. Once a simulation is opened, RMParentFrame calls RunSimulation() which is basically a helper function
	that calls GUISimulationEngine and starts that running which then runs SimulationEngine().
3. SimulationEngine() initialises scoreboard data via SimulationEngine::InitialiseScoreboardDataValues),
	talks to Scoreboard Coordinator,
	initialises Post Office and starts progress window
	process coordinator, shared attribute manager, plant coordinator and Post Office via
	SimulationEngine(), 
	
	Output rules are read in, output strategies and output files are set up

	and then all your view windows open in the program

4. dataOutputCoordinator, renderCoordinator, processCoordinator, scoreboardCoordinator
