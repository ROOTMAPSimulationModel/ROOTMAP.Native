Instructions for running ROOTMAP:

1) Extract RootMap.zip to a program directory such as C:\Program Files\Rootmap

2) Install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 redistributable. Follow the directions at http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555

3) Once the Visual C++ redistributable is installed and the computer has rebooted, run Rootmap.bat.

4) This should start ROOTMAP. Use File-->New Simulation to load the default configuration.

5) Click "No" when asked if you want to modify the configuration. The simulation will now load (may take a little while).

6) When the View windows have appeared, start the simulation running with Run-->Go.

7) To begin configuring your own simulation, close this simulation with File-->Close Simulation, then open a new one with File-->New Simulation.

8) Click "Yes" when asked if you want to modify the configuration. Step through the resulting wizard, making changes as desired.

9) When the configuration wizard is complete, start the simulation running and observe the results.
