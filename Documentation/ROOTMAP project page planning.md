## HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO USE ROOTMAP? ##

1. They need to find out about it.
2. It needs to capture their attention.
3. They need to get a basic idea of what it is and what it does. What they can do with it.
4. They need to learn how they would start using it.
5. They need to know how they can get help.

### 1. Find out about it ###

* Keyword search/SEO. Someone reading a paper written with the help of ROOTMAP should be able to search for ROOTMAP and find our page in the first few links, ideally first. Luckily ROOTMAP is not a common term.
* Links direct from published papers. Can the hosting pages of these papers be updated with new links? I don't know much about the scientific publication side of things.
* Searchable from DAFWA/UWA/UTAS sites directly.
* Promotion on DAFWA/UWA/UTAS sites.
* Direct email contact. Only appropriate for people who have enquired about ROOTMAP in the past.


### 2. Capture their attention ###

* Standard website usability principles: the ROOTMAP page must be quick to load, responsive (people won't be _downloading_ ROOTMAP from their phones, but I'd expect lots of the initial contact traffic to come that way), accessible and reasonably pleasing to the eye. If hosted by e.g. DAFWA, the page would likely use their CMS or at least their styles.
* An eye-catching image or two.
* A sentence or two of very high-level summary. "ROOTMAP is a blah blah blah".


### 3. Pitch it ###

* Examples probably the way to go here. Can simulate this and that, export these types of data, etc.
* Include some little synopses of simulations run with ROOTMAP, from the various papers.
* Mention specific capabilities - water, nitrate and phosphorus modules etc.
* Highlight capabilities ROOTMAP has that other, simpler/more generic models do not.


### 4. Quickstart ###

* Simple click-to-download installer and away you go.
    * It would be very beneficial, at this point, to have a certificate to sign the installer. Modern Windows' warning mechanism would bounce a lot of users from an unsigned installer.
* Default configuration is built in; can install it and go New Simulation and see it working.
* Link to a worked example of configuration. (A guide which takes the default configuration and turns it into, I dunno, a lupin plant or something.)
* System requirements: Windows 10 and [some] predecessors, will need to have a tested and confirmed list.


### 5. Getting help ###

* Link to a simple FAQ. Just the most common questions.
* Email addresses?
* Something forumlike where people can ask informal questions of public interest - gitter maybe?
* Link to [the pending] Github repo where they can access the code and open issues.
