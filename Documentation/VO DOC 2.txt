DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF BARRIER MODELLING FUNCTIONALITY

Barrier modelling in ROOTMAP uses mainly custom code and the Boost.Geometry computational geometry library in places where it provides a significant benefit. There are two forms of interaction covered: root (coordinate-based) and water/nutrient (ScoreboardBox-based).
